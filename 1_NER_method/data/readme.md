## Annotation of the experimental method

The goal for the NER model is to annotate the tool, instrument, assay method or kit employed to measure the experimental read-out.

To identify entities related to the experimental set-up within assay descriptions, a set of 800 assays were annotated with methodology-related terms.

A method indicator term typically followed the annotated method e.g. method, assay, analysis, test, -graphy or -metry, unless an acronym was annotated, such as ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay), where this term then became part of the acronym.
